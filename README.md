## Features

- **Retro User Interface**: Immerse yourself in the classic Windows 95 user interface, complete with windowed applications, taskbar, and desktop icons.
- **Multiple Sections**: Navigate through different sections of your portfolio, such as Education, Projects, and Skills, each presented as a separate window.
- **Windowed Applications**: Each section is represented as a windowed application, mimicking the look and feel of classic Windows 95 applications like WordPad and File Explorer.
- **Draggable and Resizable Windows**: Interact with windows just like in the original Windows 95 environment, dragging them around the screen and resizing them to your liking.
- **Integrated Email Sending**: Send emails directly from the portfolio site using the EmailJS library, seamlessly integrated into the retro-themed interface.
